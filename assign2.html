</ol>
<p>
In this assignment, create a non-distributed Java
<b>Music Browser</b> application having the ability to search for albums using
<a href="https://www.last.fm/api/"  target="_blank">Last.fm Web Services</a>
Your Solution should utilize the instructor
provided view (<b>Swing GUI</b>), which is provided in compiled form. The <b>Music Browser</b> displays
a collection of <b>Albums</b> and their <b>Tracks</b> in a Java Swing Tree. Base your solution on
the sample project (available through the Canvas Site for the class) in <b>assign2WebDist.jar</b>.
You are free to use the files contained in that example in constructing your solution.
<p>
You are to create a <b>Album</b> and <b>Track</b> classes. The information stored in these classes
is based on the information available through the
<a href="https://www.last.fm/api/"  target="_blank">Last.fm Web Services</a>.
Your classes should be able to de-serialize the <b>json</b> result from a successful <b>Last.fm</b>
<b>Album.getInfo</b> search, such as:<br></br><center>
<a href="http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=album.getinfo&artist=Cher&album=Believe&api_key=your-api=key&format=json" target="_blank">http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=album.getinfo&artist=Cher&album=Believe&api_key=your-api-key&format=json</a><br></br></center>
Register with the site to receive an <b>api-key</b> for making your requests.
Your classes objects for <b>Album</b> and <b>Track</b> should be able to serialize to and deserialize from
from <b>json</b>, thereby providing the functionality to save and restore the library to/from a
<b>json</b> text file.
The user interface provides the ability
for browsing <b>Album</b> and <b>Track</b> that are in the collection, as well as results of
successful searches. The user interface provides controls, buttons, and menu items for browsing
and managing music. Your <b>Music Browser</b> should provide the functionality to add and remove
albums and tracks. To view information about albums and tracks (by responding to tree node selection).

<p>The browser's constructor should populate the library by causing the <b>json</b> file
to be de-serialized and initializing the music library tree. Create <b>MusicLibrary</b>
class having storage for the collection of <b>Album</b> information, and provides methods, such as:
<ul>
  <li><b>getAlbumNames</b> - a method to get the titles of albums stored in the library. It could
  return an array of string titles.</li>
  <li><b>getAlbum</b> - a method to get an <b>Album</b> object based on its title. You can assume that
  all albums in the library will have a unique title.</li>
  <li><b>addAlbum</b> - a method to add an album to the library. Used for example when the user
  wants to add the result of a <b>Last.fm</b> search to the library.</li>
  <li><b>removeAlbum</b> - a method to remove an album from the library.</li>
  <li><b>saveLibraryToFile</b> - a method to serialize the library to a <b>json</b> file.</li>
  <li><b>restoreLibraryFromFile</b> - a method to (re)initialize the library by de-serializing from
  a <b>json</b> file.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>Album</b> class should have at least the following fields:
<ul>
  <li><b>Album Name</b> - the title of the album.</li>
  <li><b>Artist</b> - the artist or group name.</li>
  <li><b>Tracks</b> - a collection of <b>Track</b> objects representing the music tracks in the album.</li>
  <li><b>Image</b> - a string URL to the <b>Last.fm</b> provided image (use the <b>extralarge</b> image url,
  which is 300x300 pixels).</li>
  <li><b>Genre</b> - an optional collection of genre names.
  Some <b>Last.fm</b> searches provide tag names in the search results with provide genre information.</li>
  <li><b>Run Time</b> - Total the run time for each track in the album to get the album's total run time.
  Run time should be in the form: <b>hh:mm:ss</b>.
  </li>
  <li><b>Summary</b> - an optional summary description of the album.
  Some <b>Last.fm</b> searches provide album summary information in the search results.
  </li>
</ul>
You should also provide methods in your <b>Album</b> class for getting, adding, and removing <b>Track</b>
objects associated with the <b>Album</b>.
<p>The <b>Track</b> class should have at least the following fields:
<ul>
  <li><b>Track Name</b> - the title of the track.</li>
  <li><b>Artist</b> - the artist or group name.</li>
  <li><b>Rank Order</b> - an integer indicating the track number of this track. You should
  number all tracks in an album ignoring (don't reset to 1) multiple disks.</li>
  <li><b>Duration</b> - a string indicating the track's run time in the form: <b>mm:ss</b></li>
  <li><b>File Name</b> - a string indicating the track's mp3 file name, such as <b>ByeByeLove.mp3</b>.
  This field is optional and only needed if you are going to support associating mp3 files with
  your library together with playback.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The user interface for client is provided in the example
<b>assign2WebDist.jar</b>, which you will access through the Canvas site for the class.
It includes an <b>Ant</b> build file that will compile and execute a sample client.
It also includes <b>javadocs</b> for the instructor provided <b>MediaLibraryGui</b> class.
The sample uses the <b>JavaFX</b> framework as provided by
<a href="https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/" target="_blank">Gluon JavaFX</a>. The framework
is particular to host system and java version. The sample will run on either <b>macos</b> or
<b>Debian Linux</b>. The project contains a <b>readme.txt</b> file which details how to get
the example to run. The sample also includes serialization to/from <b>Json</b> in the
<b>MediaDescription</b> and <b>MediaLibraryImpl</b> classes.
<p>
Another example project that demonstrates serialziation to/from <b>Json</b> for both <b>C++</b> and
<b>Java</b> is provided in the example
<a href="http://pooh.poly.asu.edu/Ser321/Examples/Serial/groupJson.jar">groupJson.jar</a>.
<p>
Below is a view of the <b>MediaLibraryGui</b> that is provided in the sample.
You should use this in creating your solution.
<center><img src="./assign2Gui.png" height=420 width=860></center><br>
<p>
In summary, create a stand-alone Music Browser application, using Java.
Your application should
initialize a music library from a <b>Json</b> file, and have the ability to select, remove,
and add music.
Future assignments will build on this solution by providing a <b>Media Library Server</b> and connecting
multiple clients to the server.
<p>
<b>Functionality</b>. Here is an explanation of the functionality that
your application should provide, together with a description
of how users should interact with your <b>GUI</b> control logic.
<p>
Your application can assume that all users will only use the GUI
as it is designed to be used. That is, you do not need to validate user inputs. Further, you can assume
that your users will only request valid searches of the <b>Last.fm</b> services.
<p>
The fields on the right side of the <b>MediaLibraryGui</b> are used to
display and enter information about Albums and Tracks. <b>File, Album, Track</b> menu items are used to
manage the library. Your code should implement all menu item selections (except play is not required for
full credit). Your controller should also implement <b>Search</b> button clicks. The results of a search
should be de-serialized to create appropriate <b>Album</b> and <b>Track</b> objects and the album should
be displayed as the first album in the Tree. If the user wants to add the album to the library he/she
will select the album node in the tree and then select the <b>Album-Add</b> menu item. Tree selections
of Album or Track nodes causes the corresponding information to be displayed on the right side of the UI.
<p>
All source code you generate should be placed in the package <b>ser321.assign2.your-asuriteid.client</b>.
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Copyright and Right-to-Use</FONT></B>
<p>
Your java files should contain class comments similar in structure similar to that of the instructor's
example code.
This constraint applies to all source code you submit in this course. The comments should include a 
right-to-use license that provides the course the right to copy, execute, and evaluate the software for
purposes of course grading and program (BSSE) assessment. The comments should also include your copyright,
your name, purpose, and your contact information (email), as well as software version and
modification/creation date.
All source files/classes you generate (and submit this term) should include these comments.
If the instructor were a student in the class then his class header comments
may look like the following:

<p>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Structure of your Solution Directory</FONT></B>
<p>
Submit your solution on Canvas as a Java archive file (jar) of the project directory:
<b>Assign2</b>.
Grading your project will be done by extracting the jar and executing
the project using Ant from the command-line on Virtual Box Debian as defined as the <b>Course Development Environment</b>. You need not include <b>JavaFX</b> archive with your solution.
You also do not need to include your <b>Last.fm</b> key with your solution, but your solution should
accept the key as a command line argument.
It will be graded on Virtual Box Debian Buster and these archives will be provided to your solution
directory as they exist in the <b>assign2WebDist.jar</b> sample.
The project directory should include only the following files,
subdirectories and classes:
<ul>
  <li>The Ant directive file <b>build.xml</b>.
  The build should contain targets for
  <b>targets, clean, prepare, build,</b> and <b>execute</b>. The
  <b>execute</b>
  target compiles and executes your <b>Java</b> Music Browser with appropriate arguments.
  Other examples are covered in class to provide <b>Json</b> serialization.</li>
  <li>Subdirectory: <b>lib</b> contains <b>json.jar</b> and <b>assign2Gui.jar</b></li>
  <li>Subdirectory: <b>src/client</b> for your solution's source files.</li>
  <li>Subdirectory <b>classes</b> used to store the compiled Java class
      files. The classes folder may be generated by Ant.</li>
  <li>A file <b>music.json</b> which contains a <b>Json</b> initialization file for your
      library. </li>
</ul>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>What To Hand-In</FONT></B>
<p>
Hand-in this program by submitting a jar file to the Canvas page for this assignment.
<p>
When extracted, your solution jar file should create the directory
<b>Assign2</b>
with only your solution files as specified above. Create your jar file from
a command line whose current working directory is <b>Assign2</b>'s
parent directory. Execute the command:
<br><center><font color=#9B0033>
jar -cvf assign2myasuriteid.jar Assign2/
</font></center><br>
The instructors solution would be created and named as:
<br><center><font color=#9B0033>
